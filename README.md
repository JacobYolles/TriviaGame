# TriviaGame

This project consists of my creation of a trivia game based on computer facts, this game is specifically talored to test knowledge against coding facts, like what HTML, CSS and other things are. The game will tally how many different questions you got right how many you got wrong and give you a end page that tells you how many out of the 5 questions you got right and wrong. If the user gets the right answer it will congratulate you and show you a picture and text of the right answer. If the user gets the wrong answer it will console you and show you a picture and text of the right answer.
